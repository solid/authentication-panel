Abstract:
  A key challenge on the path toward re-decentralizing user data on the Worldwide Web is the need to
  access multiple potentially untrusted resources servers securely. This document aims to address that
  challenge by building on top of current and future web standards, to allow entities to authenticate
  within a Solid ecosystem.

# Introduction # {#intro}

*This section is non-normative*

The [Solid project](https://solidproject.org/) aims to change the way web applications work today to
improve privacy and user control of personal data by utilizing current standards, protocols, and
tools, to facilitate building extensible and modular decentralized applications based on
[Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) principles.

This specification is written for Authorization and Resource Server owners intending to implement
Solid-OIDC. It is also useful to Solid application developers charged with implementing a Solid-OIDC
client.

The [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and
[OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) web standards were
published in October 2012 and November 2014, respectively. Since publication, they have increased
with a marked pace and have claimed wide adoption with extensive *"real-world"* data and experience.
The strengths of the protocols are now clear; however, in a changing eco-system where privacy and
control of digital identities are becoming more pressing concerns, it is also clear that additional
functionality is required.

The additional functionality documented herein aims to address:

1. Resource servers having no existing trust relationship with identity providers.
2. Ephemeral Clients as a first-order use-case.

## Out of Scope ## {#intro-out-of-scope}

*This section is non-normative*

At the time of writing, there is no demonstrated use case for a strongly asserted identity; however,
it is likely that authorization requirements will necessitate it.

# Terminology # {#terms}

*This section is non-normative*

This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization server", "resource server" (RS),
"authorization endpoint", "token endpoint", "grant type", "access token request", "access token
response", and "client" defined by The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework
[[!RFC6749]].

Throughout this specification, we will use the term Identity Provider (IdP) in line with the
terminology used in the
[Open ID Connect Core 1.0 specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
(OIDC). It should be noted that
[The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) (OAuth) refers to this
same entity as an Authorization Server.

This specification also uses the following terms:

<dl>
<dt>*WebID* as defined in the [WebID 1.0 Editors Draft](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/WebID/raw-file/tip/spec/identity-respec.html)
<dd>
    A WebID is a URI with an HTTP or HTTPS scheme which denotes an Agent (Person, Organization, Group,
    Device, etc.)

<dt>*JSON Web Token (JWT)* as defined by [[!RFC7519]]
<dd>
    A string representing a set of claims as a JSON object that is encoded in a JWS or JWE, enabling the
    claims to be digitally signed or MACed and/or encrypted.

<dt>*JSON Web Key (JWK)* as defined by [[!RFC7517]]
<dd>
    A JSON object that represents a cryptographic key. The members of the object represent properties of
    the key, including its value.

<dt>*Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)* as defined in the
[DPoP Internet-Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-04)
<dd>
    A mechanism for sender-constraining OAuth tokens via a proof-of-possession mechanism on the
    application level.

<dt>*DPoP Proof* as defined by [[!DPoP]]
<dd>
    A DPoP proof is a JWT that is signed (using JWS) using a private key chosen by the client.

<dt>*Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)* as defined by [[!RFC7636]]
<dd>
    An extension to the Authorization Code flow which mitigates the risk of an authorization code
    interception attack.
</dl>

# Core Concepts # {#concepts}

*This section is non-normative*

In a decentralized ecosystem, such as Solid, an IdP may be an identity-as-a-service vendor or, at
the other end of the spectrum, a user-controlled IdP. In any case, the user may be authenticating
from a browser or an application.

Therefore, this specification assumes the use of the
[Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowSteps) with
PKCE, in accordance with OAuth and OIDC best practices. It is also assumes that there are no
preexisting trust relationship with the IdP. This means that client registration, whether dynamic,
or static, is entirely optional.

## WebIDs ## {#concepts-webids}

*This section is non-normative*

In line with Linked Data principles, a
[WebID](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/WebID/raw-file/tip/spec/identity-respec.html) is a HTTP URI that,
when dereferenced, resolves to a profile document that is structured data in an
[RDF 1.1 format](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/). This profile document allows
people to link with others to grant access to identity resources as they see fit. WebIDs underpin
Solid and are used as a primary identifier for Users and Client applications in this specification.

# Basic Flow # {#basic-flow}

*This section is non-normative*

The basic authentication and authorization flow is as follows:

1. The Client requests a non-public resource from the RS.
2. The RS returns a 401 with a `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header containing parameters that inform the
    Client that a DPoP-bound Access Token is required.
3. The Client presents its Client Identifier and the associated Secret to the IdP and requests an
    Authorization Code.
4. If granted, the Client presents the Authorization Code and a DPoP proof, to the Token Endpoint.
5. The Token Endpoint returns a DPoP-bound Access Token and OIDC ID Token, to the Client.
6. The Client presents the DPoP-bound Access Token and DPoP proof, to the RS.
7. The RS gets the public key from the IdP and uses it to validate the signature on DPoP-bound Access Token (JWS).
8. If the DPoP proof and Access Token are valid then The RS returns the requested resource.

# Client Identifiers # {#clientids}

OAuth and OIDC require the Client application to identify itself to the IdP and RS by presenting a
[client identifier](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.2) (Client ID). Solid applications
SHOULD use a WebID as their Client ID.

## WebID ## {#clientids-webid}

The WebID itself MUST resolve to an RDF document that MUST include a single `solid:oidcRegistration`
property. That property MUST be a JSON serialization of an OIDC client registration, per the definition
of client registration metadata from [[!RFC7591]] section 2.

Issue: [Related Issue](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/75) 
Solid-OIDC client description in WebID document 

Also, the IdP MUST dereference the Client's WebID document and match any Client-supplied parameters,
with the values in the Client's WebID document.

Further, the `redirect_uri` provided by the Client MUST be included in the registration `redirect_uris`
list.

NOTE: the method by which the IdP resolves the WebID to an RDF document, is defined in
[WebID 1.0](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/identity/#processing-the-webid-profile).
This example uses [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/):

<div class='example'>
    <p>https://app.example/webid#id

    <pre>
        @prefix solid: <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#> .

        <#id> solid:oidcRegistration """{
            "client_id" : "https://app.example/webid#id",
            "redirect_uris" : ["https://app.example/callback"],
            "client_name" : "Solid Application Name",
            "client_uri" : "https://app.example/",
            "logo_uri" : "https://app.example/logo.png",
            "tos_uri" : "https://app.example/tos.html",
            "scope" : "openid profile offline_access",
            "grant_types" : ["refresh_token","authorization_code"],
            "response_types" : ["code"],
            "default_max_age" : 60000,
            "require_auth_time" : true
            }""" .
    </pre>
</div>

## The Public WebID ## {#clientids-public-webid}

Ephemeral Clients MAY use the identifier `http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#PublicOidcClient`. If the
Client uses this identifier then IdP MAY accept any `redirect_uri` as valid. Since it is public, the
Client is effectively anonymous to the RS.

## OIDC Registration ## {#clientids-oidc}

If the Client does not use a WebID as the client identifier, then it MUST present a client identifier
registered with the IdP via either OIDC dynamic or static registration.

# Token Instantiation # {#tokens}

Assuming the Client ID and Secret, and the DPoP Proof are valid, the IdP MUST return two tokens to
the Client:

1. A DPoP-bound Access Token
2. An OIDC ID Token

## DPoP-bound Access Token ## {#tokens-access}

The DPoP-bound Access Token MUST be a valid JWT. See [[!RFC7519]].

When requesting an DPoP-bound Access Token, the Client MUST send the IdP a DPoP proof that is valid
according to the [DPoP Internet-Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-04).

The DPoP-bound Access Token MUST contain at least these claims:

`webid` — REQUIRED. This claim MUST be the user's WebID.

`iss` — REQUIRED. The issuer claim MUST be a valid URL of the IdP instantiating this token.

`aud` — REQUIRED. However, the DPoP token provides the full URL of the request, making the `aud`
claim redundant, so in Solid-OIDC the `aud` claim MUST be a string with the value of `solid`.

`iat` — REQUIRED. The issued-at claim is the time at which this crendential was issued.

`exp` — REQUIRED. This credential expiration is seperate from the ID tokens expiration.

`cnf` — For all flows that require DPoP, the confirmation claim is REQUIRED, as per
[DPoP Internet-Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-04#section-7) specification.

`client_id` — REQUIRED in all flows except OIDC registration.

<div class="example">
    <p>An example DPoP-bound Access Token:

    <pre>
    {
        "webid": "https://janedoe.com/web#id",
        "iss": "https://idp.example.com",
        "aud": "solid",
        "iat": 1541493724,
        "exp": 1573029723,
        "cnf":{
        "jkt":"0ZcOCORZNYy-DWpqq30jZyJGHTN0d2HglBV3uiguA4I"
        },
        "client_id": "https://client.example.com/web#id"
    }
    </pre>
</div>

## OIDC ID Token ## {#tokens-id}

The subject (`sub`) claim MUST be the user's WebID.

<div class="example">
    <p>An example OIDC ID Token:

    <pre>
        {
            "iss": "https://idp.example.com",
            "sub": "https://janedoe.com/web#id",
            "aud": "https://client.example.com",
            "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
            "exp": 1311281970,
            "iat": 1311280970,
        }
    </pre>
</div>

# Resource Access # {#resource}

## DPoP Proof Validation ## {#resource-dpop-validation}

A DPoP Proof that is valid according to
[DPoP Internet-Draft, Section 4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-04#section-4.2),
MUST be present when a DPoP-bound Access Token is used.

## Access Token Validation ## {#resource-access-validation}

The DPoP-bound Access Token MUST be validated according to
[DPoP Internet-Draft, Section 7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-04#section-7)
but the RS MAY perform additional verification in order to determine whether to grant access to the
requested resource.

The user's WebID in the `webid` claim MUST be dereferenced and checked against the `iss` claim in the
Access Token. If the `iss` claim is different from the domain of the WebID, then the RS MUST check
the WebID document for an existance of a statement matching `?webid <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#oidcIssuer> ?iss.`
Where `?webid` and `?iss` are values of `webid` and `iss` claims accordingly.
This prevents a malicious identity provider from issuing valid Access Tokens for arbitrary WebIDs.

Unless RS knows IdP keys through some other means, or IdP chooses to reject tokens issued by this IdP,
the IdP MUST follow OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [[!OpenID.Discovery]] to find an IdP's signing keys (JWK).

# Security Considerations # {#security}

*This section is non-normative*

As this specification builds upon existing web standards, security considerations from OAuth, OIDC,
PKCE, and the DPoP specifications may also apply unless otherwise indicated. The following
considerations should be reviewed by implementors and system/s architects of this specification.

## TLS Requirements ## {#security-tls}

All TLS requirements outlined in [[BCP195](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195)] apply to this
specification.

All tokens, Client, and User credentials MUST only be transmitted over TLS.

## Client IDs ## {#security-client-ids}

An RS SHOULD assign a fixed set of low trust policies to any client identified as anonymous.

Implementors SHOULD expire Client IDs that are kept in server storage to mitigate the potential for
a bad actor to fill server storage with unexpired or otherwise useless Client IDs.

## Client Secrets ## {#security-client-secrets}

Client secrets SHOULD NOT be stored in browser local storage. Doing so will increase the risk of
data leaks should an attacker gain access to Client credentials.

## Client Trust ## {#security-client-trust}

*This section is non-normative*

Clients are ephemeral, client registration is optional, and most Clients cannot keep secrets. These,
among other factors, are what makes Client trust challenging.

# Privacy Considerations # {#privacy}

## Access Token Reuse ## {#privacy-token-reuse}

*This section is non-normative*

With JWTs being extendable by design, there is potential for a privacy breach if Access Tokens get
reused across multiple resource servers. It is not unimaginable that a custom claim is added to the
Access Token on instantiation. This addition may unintentionally give other resource servers
consuming the Access Token information about the user that they may not wish to share outside of the
intended RS.
