### Misc questions

* AvdB: I shared a question on gitter before the call: "The Solid OIDC specification in section 5.1 pertaining Client ID documents: 'When a Client Identifier is dereferenced, the resource MUST be serialized as an `application/ld+json` document unless content negotiation requires a different outcome.' If the resource MUST be `application/ld+json`, how would content negotiation require a different outcome? Shouldn't a server just error if a Client ID document is retrieved with a `content-type` other than `application/ld+json`?"
* AC: We want to provide clarity on the format of the resource: all clients must be able to expect a JSON-LD serialized resource. A server could *in addition* allow content negotiation to support additional serializations, but JSON-LD is a baseline. The exact formulation is inspired from LDP, but it could certainly be clarified if required. For content negotiation, in the case there is an `Accept` header present, either the server supports one of the requested formats, or not. In the latter case, a `406` may be responded.
* AvdB: My understanding of the formulation is that in the case of a failure of content negotiation, `json+ld` should always be returned, even in case of `406`.
* AC: The server would default to `json+ld` even if the client was asking for another format if the server doesn't understand content negotiation at all, e.g., it is a static file server.
* AvdB: In our deployment, the client identifier is served as a file, and always returns `json+ld`. Would you say it isn't the most correct implementation?
* AC: That's a completely valid implementation. It's up to the client to check the `Content-Type` header value before attempting any form of parsing. There are multiple reasons for which a client may get back an unexpected format, and they should handle this properly. Maybe a `406` response is "most" correct in a sense, but returning `json+ld` is absolutely correct too.

### Implementation feedback

* NS: The CSS implementation has been changed to include an additional parameter: `iss=<IRI>` ([RFC 9207](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207)). This allows a client to check that the auth code is coming from the expected identity provider. In a closed ecosystem, this isn't a significant issue, but in an open ecosystem, this can trip up a client.
