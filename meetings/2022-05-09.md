### Misc questions

* AvdB: I shared a question on gitter before the call: "The Solid OIDC specification in section 5.1 pertaining Client ID documents: 'When a Client Identifier is dereferenced, the resource MUST be serialized as an application/ld+json document unless content negotiation requires a different outcome.' If the resource MUST be application/ld+json, how would content negotiation require a different outcome? Shouldn't a server just error if a Client ID document is retrieved with a content-type other than application/ld+json?"
* AC: We want to provide clarity on the format of the resource: all clients must be able to expect a JSON-LD serialized resource. A server could *in addition* allow content negotiation to support additional serializations, but JSON-LD is a baseline. The exact formulation is inspired from LDP, but it could certainly be clarified if required. For content negotiation, in the case there is an `Accept` header present, either the server supports one of the requested formats, or not. In the latter case, a 406 may be responded.
* AvdB: My understanding of the formulation is that in the case of a failure of content negotiation, json+ld should always be returned, even in case of 406
* AC: The server would default to json+ld even if the client was asking for another format if the server doesn't understand content negotiation at all, e.g. it is a static file server.
* AvdB: In our deployment, the client identifier is served as a file, and always returns json+ld. Would you say it isn't the most correct implementation.
* AC: That's a completely valid implemention. It's up to the client to check the Content-Type header value before attempting to any form of parsing. There are multiple reasons for which a client may get back an unexpected format, and they should handle this properly. Maybe a 406 response is "most" correct in a sense, but returning json+ld is absolutely correct too.

### Implementation feedback

* NS: The CSS implementation has been changed to include an additional parameter: `iss=<IRI>` ([RFC 9207](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207)). This allows a client to check that the auth code is coming from the expected identity provider. In a closed ecosystem, this isn't a significant issue, but in an open ecosystem, this can trip up a client.
