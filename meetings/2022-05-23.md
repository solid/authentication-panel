## Minutes

### Require "webid" scope for OIDC Dynamic Client Registration #168

* AC: Should webid be a must? Let's say you initiate DCR and specify that you want scopes `openid email`. Later on you want to use `client_id` and `client_secret` with an additional scope. An OP would give an invalid scope error.
* eP: We only talk about making it must on the client, so Solid App since we do it in Solid-OIDC spec.
* AC: that makes sense

### Autoexpiry of DCR-registered clients

* AC: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591#section-3.2.1 
* ...: response has `client_secret_expires_at`, a time when it will expire or `0` if it doesn't expire. Server has to present this value in the reponse. 
* eP: Isn't DCR an ephemeral client?
* AC: For me any DCR client is ephemeral. I would like to in general discourage use of ephemeral clients.
* eP: Are there other clients that are not DCR clients that we would consider ephemeral?
* AC: I don't think so
* eP: will respond to the issue and will change working to explicitly call DCR clients as ephemeral clients


Next meeting will be in two weeks: 2022-06-06
